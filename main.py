    - Make sure you do NOT share your botToken file (add it to your gitignore)!

This is not the first bot I have made, but it is the first I am releasing publicly. Please
do not hesitate to content me if you find anything I missed.

This bot blocks words that you specify under the blockedWords variable.
Remember that when you add words, put them in quotes ("") and add a comma at
the end of it only if you are adding another word under it. Do not add a comma
if it is the last word in the list (Python doesn't care, but JSON files do care).
